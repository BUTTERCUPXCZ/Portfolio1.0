# Download Instructions

This folder contains downloadable project files for your portfolio website.

## How to add your actual project files:

1. Create ZIP archives of your projects
2. Replace the placeholder files in this folder with your actual project ZIP files
3. Make sure to keep the same filenames as referenced in your Portfolio.jsx component:
   - project1.zip
   - project2.zip  
   - project3.zip

## Notes:

- Files placed in the public folder are served as-is
- The paths in your code should be relative to the public folder (e.g., '/downloads/project1.zip')
- Ensure your ZIP files are not too large to avoid long download times
- You may want to include a README file in each ZIP explaining how to use the project
